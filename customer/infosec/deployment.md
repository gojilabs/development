# Deployment Workflow
Each developer works within the operating system of their choice, while considering the needs of the application. For example, an iOS application can only be built on macOS. We use Git to version-control our code, and we use private Github repositories as our Git remote repositories. Each developer submits a pull request for review in Github, and it is then checked by either a peer or a lead developer. Reviewers evaluate for simplicity, correctness, and clarity. Once any issues are resolved, the pull request is approved and merged. With each merge a Github Action is triggered, which builds the source code into a container and prepares it for deployment. The final step of the Github Action is to push the successfully built container into Digital Ocean Container Registry and notify Kubernetes of the new container. Kubernetes then spins up new pods running the new container, and once these new pods pass health checks, all traffic is directed to them and the old containers are terminated.
