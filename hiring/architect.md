# Architect

An architect's role is to be the technical authority on their projects. They often develop much of the systems themselves, but they also may lead a team of developers. They are ultimately responsible for the successful development and delivery of their projects.

## Responsibilities
- Understand the business or organization landscape that the client is in
- Collaborate with design to make the product more intuitive and easier to develop
- Envision how each piece of the infrastructure will work together
- Decide which technologies to use according to the combination of this product, our skillset, and the timeline
- Break the systems into functional components or modules and estimate the time/effort for each
- Plan the development roadmap so that these modules are built in the correct order, optimizing for time and quality
- Advocate for a minimum viable product
- Plan the data model, including database indexes, data validations, constraints, and any necessary database views
- Plan the API contract between the backend system and all consumers of that system
- Develop the entire backend system if necessary
- Collaborate with the frotend engineering team to aid in the integration of any API consumers
- Take responsibility for overall project code quality
- Review other developers' code for correctness and clarity
- Regularly strategize with the project manager to increase the likelihood of launching the project successfully and on-time
- Identify when other developers are stuck on a problem and intervene
- Decide when to stubbornly solve tricky issues or when to circumvent/come up with a good-enough alternative
